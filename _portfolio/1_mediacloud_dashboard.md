In this project, we developed an interactive dashboard to visualize clusters of the top ten news events during a specific period of the US election. The backend processes involve clustering news articles, while the frontend interactively displays these clusters. We used a fine-tuned BERT model to embed the articles, which were then clustered using the OSLOM algorithm. The front end was built using Python and Streamlit. This project was conducted as part of my Summer 2024 internship with Media Cloud.
