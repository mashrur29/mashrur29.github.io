However, the traditional DCOP formulation does not consider constraints that must be satisfied (hard constraints), rather it concentrates only on constraints that place no restriction on satisfaction (soft constraints). This is a serious shortcoming as many real-world applications involve both types of constraints. Traditional DPOP algorithms are not able to benefit from the existence of hard constraints, where an additional calculation is required to handle such constraints. This results in longer runtimes. Thus scalability remains an issue. Additionally, in the standard DPOP, the agents are arranged as a Depth First Search (DFS) pseudo-tree, but recent work has shown that the construction of pseudo-trees in this way often leads to chain-like communication structures that greatly impair the algorithm’s performance. To address these issues, we develop an algorithm that speeds up the DPOP algorithm by reducing the size of the messages exchanged and increases parallelism in the pseudo tree. For this purpose, initially, we improve the path for exchanging messages. Next, we introduce a new form of constraint propagation, which we call cross-edge consistency. Our theoretical evaluation shows that our proposed algorithm is complete and correct. In empirical evaluations, our algorithm achieves a significant reduction in the runtime, ranging from 4% to 96%, compared to the state-of-the-art.	"Rashik, Mashrur, et al.

2021-12-01	Mapping Instability: The Effects of the Pandemic on the Civic Life of a Small Town	Environments By Design: Health, Wellbeing, and Place Conference	The pandemic directly impacted the presence of the students from UMass and the surrounding colleges, but in disparate ways; while UMass students were sent home, the students from Amherst college and the other neighboring liberal arts colleges were provided some form of residency (still, extremely limited to a life within the confines of their small campuses). To investigate this phenomenon, our interdisciplinary team of architects and computer scientists began an investigatory process of tracking movement and mapping patterns of mobility as it is related to the unmeasured aspects of the pandemic. It is from these observations that our team set out to analyze the short-term and long-term effects of the pandemic, specifically regarding the residents of a small town. We had a special interest in studying issues related to mobility and access to collective resources and were invested in using our specialized ways of researching and individual interests in the built environment and digital civics to investigate larger patterns of how a major crisis and its social, economic, and cultural repercussions affect one’s sense of community, mobility, and social connectedness.

2023-04-16	CommunityBots: Creating and Evaluating A Multi-Agent Chatbot Platform for Public Input Elicitation	ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW)	In recent years, the popularity of AI-enabled conversational agents or chatbots has risen as an alternative to traditional online surveys to elicit information from people. However, there is a gap in using single-agent chatbots to converse and gather multi-faceted information across a wide variety of topics. Prior works suggest that single-agent chatbots struggle to understand user intentions and interpret human language during a multi-faceted conversation. In this work, we investigated how multi-agent chatbot systems can be utilized to conduct a multi-faceted conversation across multiple domains. To that end, we conducted a Wizard of Oz study to investigate the design of a multi-agent chatbot for gathering public input across multiple high-level domains and their associated topics. Next, we designed, developed, and evaluated CommunityBots - a multi-agent chatbot platform where each chatbot handles a different domain individually. To manage conversation across multiple topics and chatbots, we proposed a novel Conversation and Topic Management (CTM) mechanism that handles topic-switching and chatbot-switching based on user responses and intentions. We conducted a between-subject study comparing CommunityBots to a single-agent chatbot baseline with 96 crowd workers. The results from our evaluation demonstrate that CommunityBots participants were significantly more engaged, provided higher quality responses, and experienced fewer conversation interruptions while conversing with multiple different chatbots in the same session. We also found that the visual cues integrated with the interface helped the participants better understand the functionalities of the CTM mechanism, which enabled them to perceive changes in textual conversation, leading to better user satisfaction. Based on the empirical insights from our study, we discuss future research avenues for multi-agent chatbot design and its application for rich information elicitation.

2024-07-01	Beyond Text and Speech in Conversational Agents: Mapping the Design Space of Avatars	ACM Designing Interactive Systems (DIS) Conference	Conversational agents have gained widespread popularity due to their ability to simulate and sustain contextual conversations. Prior works predominantly focused on computational challenges. However, avatars — the representation of the agent — impact user interactions and perception of conversational agents’ trustworthiness and usefulness. Despite their importance, we lack a holistic understanding of conversational agent avatar design space. In this work, we address this gap by defining a categorization of 10 dimensions that is based on the analysis and iterative coding of 266 conversational agent papers from 160 venues spanning 2003 to the present. In addition, we built an interactive browser to facilitate exploration and interaction with these dimensions and their interrelationships. Our categorization lays the groundwork for researchers, designers, and practitioners to discern task-specific and contextual aspects of conversational agent avatar design. Our work fosters innovative ideas to facilitate new interactions with avatars by surfacing current patterns and highlighting open challenges.	"Rashik, Mashrur, et al.
