<p align="justify"> 
I am a 3rd year Computer Science MS/PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My research interest lies in the intersections of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I work in the HCI-VIS Lab under the supervision of Dr. Narges Mahyar and Dr. Ali Sarvghad. At the HCI-VIS Lab, I have worked on building conversational systems for journaling and public informational elicitation. In addition to creating NLP systems, I am also interested in conversational interfaces and have worked on categorizing the literature on conversational agent avatars. Before UMass, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at TigerIT Bangladesh Ltd, working on Conversational AI and Machine Translation. I have a strong passion for problem-solving and software development alongside my research interests. During my undergraduate studies, I actively participated in competitive programming and was fortunate enough to win several hackathons.
